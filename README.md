These repo serves as a collection of shell scripts that convert easylist to privoxy configs.

privoxy-blocklist.sh is the [original idea](https://andrwe.org/scripting/bash/privoxy-blocklist).

privoxy-adblock.sh has been tweaked in a way that it will run OS-X, besides I can confirm that it works on my Fedora 27 with bash. See its [README](README_privoxy-adblock.md) for details.

Both scripts have been (slightly) modified, see my commit message for details.
